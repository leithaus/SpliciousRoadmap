<center><h2>Financials should include adventurous as well as conservative opportunities</h2></center>
<center><p class="p1">The first of the real market opportunities bloom when the user base realizes the platform becomes a distributed, decentralized virtual market. Think about it like a distributed CraigsList + AngiesList + eBay + PayPal. Then, even if the transaction fees remain at 2%, the average transaction goes to around 100 USD (.5 BTC). Now, you only need .5M transactions / month to make a 1M USD / month. If you compare this to CraigsList + eBay + ... volumes, you see this is a huge market potential.</p></center>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<center><p class="p1">Conservatively, if you focus on the arts markets for the first 2.5 years to establish brand and trust and then expand to distributed virtual market place in the next 2.5 years, you find a company with roughly 100M / anum  in profit. </p></center>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<center><p class="p1">To be clear, this is still only the conservative vision. A much more significant potential, and one that is much harder to quantify are the privacy applications. We've been engaged with the thought leaders in that market for over four years. It was very eye-opening when Ian Bailey, Chief Privacy Officer of the Provence of British Columbia, in a face-to-face meeting gave us the very scenario we'd <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz2pmVGgrG4"><span class="s1">independently made the video about</span></a> as the kind of service BC would like to provide with their Internet-enabled identity smart cards. Ian is thinking about Canada-wide privacy and personal information services. He explicitly wants a platform that is not managed by the Canadian government for myriad reasons. That's just Canada.</p></center>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<center><p class="p1">The segue to the global perspective is important in the context of how most investors are thinking about BTC. Adam Draper and his father Tim Draper (of Draper Fisher Jurvetson), are two high profile investors who believe, with many, that the real BTC opportunities are in the South American and African markets, where they are poised to skip several first world financial services steps, just like they skipped the landline telecommunications steps and went straight to mobile. When you factor in those markets, the conservative growth potential undergoes a 10X expansion.</p></center>
