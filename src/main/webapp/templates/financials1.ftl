<center><h2>Financials should be common sense</h2></center>
<center><p class="p1">The bulk of our financials are common sense, back of the envelope calculations. When the most common transaction is around 50c (1 mBTC), then it easily and comfortably bears a 2% transaction cost, while leaving head room for growth, as services and features, brand name and loyalty begin to allow an increase in transaction cost. To make 1M USD in a given time period (say 1 month) you need a transaction volume of 100M transactions Â / month.</p></center>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<center><p class="p1">Certainly, iTunes+AMZN+GooglePlay+CDBaby+... suggests there is that kind of market volume available in the music sector alone. The requirement is to engage that market. We feel the Splicious approach offers that particular market a lot of reasons to engage. </p></center>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<center><p class="p1">The important thing to remember is that music is only one kind of offering that people regularly share. We believe the publishing sector is equally fruitful and the Splicious brand wide enough, because of the focus on privacy, to encompass that market. Specifically, one really untapped financial potential is fan fiction (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f700b6IHZcc"><span class="s1">hence the video we shared</span></a>). That market is just waiting to be monetized which will, in turn, fuel growth in that sector.</p></center>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<center><p class="p1">With these two markets alone it should be possible to reach over 200M transactions / month in under 5 years. Accounting for growth, the operating costs should remain well under 2M / anum. So, if you never looked at any other market opportunities, this should be a company with roughly 20M / anum in profit in less than 5 years, without breaking a sweat.</p></center>
