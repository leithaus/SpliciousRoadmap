      <p class="p1">The bulk of our financials are common sense, back of the envelope calculations. When the most common transaction is around 50c (1 mBTC), then it easily and comfortably bears a 2% transaction cost, while leaving head room for growth, as services and features, brand name and loyalty begin to allow an increase in transaction cost. (More on that if/when we have a phone call or Skype session.) To make 1M USD in a given time period (say 1 month) you need a transaction volume of 100M transactions  / month.</p>
      <p class="p2"><br></p>
      <p class="p1">Certainly, iTunes+AMZN+GooglePlay+CDBaby+... suggests there is that kind of market volume available in the music sector alone. The requirement is to engage that market. We feel the Splicious approach offers that particular market a lot of reasons to engage. i can discuss our market research data suggesting why we think our approach will work in much more detail, but let me save that for subsequent conversations.</p>
      <p class="p2"><br></p>
      <p class="p1">The important thing to remember is that music is only one kind of offering that people regularly share. We believe publishing sector is equally lucrative and the Splicious brand wide enough, because of the focus on privacy, to encompass that market. Specifically, one really untapped financial potential is fan fiction (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f700b6IHZcc"><span class="s1">hence the video we shared</span></a>). That market is just waited to be monetized which will, in turn, fuel growth in that sector.</p>
      <p class="p2"><br></p>
      <p class="p1">With these two markets alone it should be possible to reach over 200M transactions / month in under 5 years. Accounting for growth, the operating costs should remain well under 2M / anum. So, if you never looked at any other market opportunities, this should be a company with roughly 20M / anum in profit in less than 5 years, without breaking a sweat.</p>
      <p class="p2"><br></p>
      <p class="p1">However, the first of the real market opportunities are when the user base realizes the platform becomes a distributed, decentralized virtual market. Think about it like a distributed CraigsList + AngiesList + eBay + PayPal. Then, even if the transaction fees remain at 2%, the average transaction goes to around 100 USD (.5 BTC). Now, you only need .5M transactions / month to make a 1M USD / month. If you compare this to CraigsList + eBay + ... volumes, you see this is a huge market potential.</p>
      <p class="p2"><br></p>
      <p class="p1">Conservatively, if you focus on the arts markets for the first 2.5 years to establish brand and trust and then expand to distributed virtual market place in the next 2.5 years, you find a company with roughly 100M / anum  in profit. </p>
      <p class="p2"><br></p>
      <p class="p1">To be clear, this is still only the conservative vision. A much more significant potential, and one that is much harder to quantify are the privacy applications. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz2pmVGgrG4"><span class="s1">Here's a short video about one of the potential privacy applications</span></a>. We've been engaged with the thought leaders in that market for over four years. It was very eye-opening when Ian Bailey, Chief Privacy Officer of the Provence of British Columbia, in a face-to-face meeting gave us the very scenario we'd independently made the video about as the kind of service BC would like to provide with their Internet-enabled identity smart cards. Ian is thinking about Canada-wide privacy and personal information services. He explicitly wants a platform that is not managed by the Canadian government for myriad reasons. That's just Canada.</p>
      <p class="p2"><br></p>
      <p class="p1">The segue to the global perspective is important in the context of how most investors are thinking about BTC. Adam Draper and his father Tim Draper (of Draper Fisher Jurvetson), are two high profile investors who believe, with many, that the real BTC opportunities are in the South American and African markets, where they are poised to skip several first world financial services steps, just like they skipped the landline telecommunications steps and went straight to mobile. When you factor in those markets, the conservative growth potential undergoes a 10X expansion.</p>
